This work was done in conjunction with Los Alamos National Lab. This time with Travis Trahan, Tim Burke, and Collin Josey. As with [flocking a](/work/trt), my editorialization must be limited to what is in the paper itself in order to spare myself the bureaucratic hassle of filing this dumb stuff for official review.

Just as a brief introduction: Monte Carlo Application Toolkit or MCATK is available from Los Alamos National Lab and does exactly what it sounds like. My job was to implement an idea my boss (Travis Trahan) had in it.

The paper was written for the International conference on Math & Comp in Niagara Falls, ON, Can.
