I'm a grad student at Oregon State University where I will get my PhD in mechanical engineering with an emphasis in thermal fluid sciences and a minor in nuclear engineering sometime in 2025. 

My current research is in dynamic Monte Carlo neutron transport for high performance/heterogeneous compute systems enabled by Python. This research is part of the Center for Exascale Monte Carlo Neutron Transport (CEMeNT) which is funded by the NNSA, through which I will get to run computer programs on some of the largest supercomputers in the world!

I also currently work with adding functionality to production transport codes at Los Alamos National Lab. Previously I have interned at Argonne and Thomas Jefferson National Labs where I worked on superconducting/conventional particle accelerator magnet design.

In 2020 I graduated magna cum laude from the Oregon Institute of Technology with my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and two minors in applied physics and applied mathematics.

Otherwise I am known for making a pretty good pun every now and again and kicking butt at trivia!
