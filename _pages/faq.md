## Open positions

I am not currently hiring for any postdoctoral positions.

I also do not currently have funding for new graduate research assistants. However, I am open to advising graduate students in research who are funded through a teaching assistantship. To learn more, here is [info for prospective students](https://physics.oregonstate.edu/graduate/prospective-students).

## Recommendation letters

I am generally open to writing letters of recommendations for students who have completed courses I teach or who I have worked closely with in other capacities. Please know that I receive many requests for recommendation letters. The more advance notice and details you can provide about the opportunity, the more likely it is that I can accept your request and write a strong letter. 

Please email me to request, and include the following info:
- A list of the opportunities you need a letter of recommendation for
- A list of the deadlines for each opportunity (please know that I can rarely accommodate requests made within 2 weeks of a deadline)
- Any specific experiences or skills you would like me to highlight in the letter

## Undergraduate physics thesis requirements

Undergraduate physics majors must complete a (Writing Intensive Course) WIC requirement to graduate. This means completing either PH 317 (Advanced Physics Lab) or PH 403 (Physics Thesis, listed as 491/2/3 in future terms). I am the instructor for PH 403.

I get many questions about the course structure, timeline, and research coordination of the physics thesis option. These can usually be answered by this [general overview of the thesis option and some FAQ](https://physics.oregonstate.edu/undergraduate/academics/writing-intensive-courses).

I also get many questions about the eligibility, expectations, and approval of thesis research mentors who aren't in the OSU physics. Here is [detailed info about how to navigate that situation](https://physics.oregonstate.edu/undergraduate/academics/writing-intensive-courses/thesis-advisors), as well as other detail about research mentor expectations.

If you are a physics major searching for potential research mentors, check out this [list of available projects](https://physics.oregonstate.edu/undergraduate/academics/writing-intensive-courses/thesis-project).
