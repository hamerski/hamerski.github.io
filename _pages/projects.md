## Generative AI and Creativity in Computational Physics

The goal of this project is to characterize how students use generative AI (gen-AI) in the computational physics course offerings at OSU. We are trying to identify how to support students to use gen-AI in ways that enable them to express creativity and learn computational physics. We have begun to explore different ways that students use gen-AI in computational physics courses. 

We aim to use the ongoing research to produce a set of curricular guidelines for enabling students to develop their computational creativity in the face of ever-present gen-AI tools, including strategies for updating curricula as gen-AI continues to evolve through technological advancements.

## Transfer Student Advocacy and Institutional Change

This project team is composed of a group of physics transfer students and faculty members who meet on a regular basis to learn about institutional change processes, build a shared understanding of the challenges facing transfer students in OSU's physics department, and develop a unified vision for a more transfer-supportive physics department. Coined as the Transfer Advocacy Alliance for Physics Success (TAAPS), the group continues to meet, gather support and input from other physics students and faculty, and build a plan for a physics transfer student peer mentorship program.

Research on this project, though still being designed, will aim to learn from the perspectives of transfer students and others who play key roles in the transfer process, and work together with them to shape and implement institutional change on a departmental level.

## Transgender STEM Graduate Student Experiences

This project, currently in an initial exploratory phase, aims to construct a landscape of trans STEM graduate student experiences at OSU and more broadly. We hope to use ethnographic research methods to construct both individual narratives of trans graduate students and broader characterizations of the challenges and supports they experience in their STEM graduate programs.
