My friends call me Piper or Pipes but Joanna or any nicknames derivative of that will work!

I'm a grad student at Oregon State University where I will get my PhD in mechanical engineering with an option in thermal fluid sciences and a minor in nuclear engineering sometime in 2025 (fingers crossed). 

My current research is in dynamic Monte Carlo neutron transport for high performance/heterogeneous compute systems enabled by Python. This research is part of the [Center for Exascale Monte Carlo Neutron Transport (CEMeNT)](https://cement-psaap.github.io/) which is funded by the NNSA, through which I will get to run computer programs on some of the largest supercomputers in the world! I also work on developing transient deterministic neutron transport algorithms for GPU computations.

In addition to my research at OSU with CEMeNT I am currently working at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).

I have previously worked with adding functionality to production transport codes at Los Alamos National Lab (XCP-3 & CCS-2). Before that I interned at Argonne and Thomas Jefferson National Labs where I worked on superconducting and conventional particle accelerator magnet design and optimization.

In my free time I like to volunteer at the historic [Whiteside Theater](https://www.whitesidetheatre.org/) in Corvallis, bake my fair share of carrot cake, and watch wayyyyyy too much youtube. Otherwise I am known for making a pretty good pun every now and again and kicking butt at trivia!

## Academic Lineage
My full academic lineage can be found thru my advisor's ([Kyle Niemeyer](https://niemeyer-research-group.github.io/)) [Mathematics Genealogy Project profile](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=180371). It's kinda fun to go snooping around and see who you can find!

## I am a trans woman
This is a statement of the condition of my soul.\\
It is self evident and immutable.\\
It is not up for debate, negotiation, or compromise.\\
It is simple in its structure but impossibly complex its ramifications.\\
It is truth.

At the end of the day I am just playing the hand I was dealt in a world that often really hates my cards.
I hope you can say the same.

To trans people out there---I'd love to hear from you, *especially* if you're in my felid!
Shoot me an email!
Let's get coffee!

To my professional colleagues---if you want, feel free to ask appropriate questions at an appropriate time, provided they are steeped in a desire to know me and my story more.
Golden rule always applies.
