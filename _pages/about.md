My friends call me Piper but Joanna or any nicknames derivative of that will work!

I'm a grad student at Oregon State University where I will get my PhD in mechanical engineering with an emphasis in thermal fluid sciences and a minor in nuclear engineering sometime in 2025. 

My current research is in dynamic Monte Carlo neutron transport for high performance/heterogeneous compute systems enabled by Python. This research is part of the [Center for Exascale Monte Carlo Neutron Transport (CEMeNT)](https://cement-psaap.github.io/) which is funded by the NNSA, through which I will get to run computer programs on some of the largest supercomputers in the world!

I also currently work with adding functionality to production transport codes at Los Alamos National Lab. Previously I have interned at Argonne and Thomas Jefferson National Labs where I worked on superconducting/conventional particle accelerator magnet design.

In 2020 I graduated magna cum laude from the Oregon Institute of Technology with my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and two minors in applied physics and applied mathematics.

In my free time I like to volunteer at the historic [Whiteside Theater](https://www.whitesidetheatre.org/) in Corvallis and watch wayyyyyy too much youtube. Otherwise I am known for making a pretty good pun every now and again and kicking butt at trivia! 

At my core I am just a big ol goober

## Academic Lineage
My full academic lineage can be found thru my advisor's ([Kyle Niemeyer](https://niemeyer-research-group.github.io/)) [Mathematics Genealogy Project profile](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=180371). it's kinda fun to go snooping around and see who you can find!

## *in somins veritas*
is my personal motto. The translation from latin is `in dreams, truth`. My affinity for this phrase actually predates my transition (I am a transgender woman if that hasn't been made obvious yet) and is *almost* too clichéd in light of it. None the less I like it. At some point I wild hair---I was drunk---to write this poem which I feel like captures it's meaning to me. A little pretentious but whatever; this page is about me and this is very much an expression of myself:

that first breath you take when you know Freedom, \\
that first step when you see the coming of the Dawn, \\
that first glimpse at the potential of the Morning, \\
that first moment of your life is as a Phenix song
{: style="text-align: center;"}

it sings in spite of the ratchet straps of old \\
the spurious ansätze that led to false roots \\
it sings to Righteous crescendo in omnipotent harmony \\
sans Doubt to boot.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

*in somnis veritas*, guides towards \\
*ad augusta per angusta*, \\
dreams of narrow roads to the high places \\
as the old world schleps into avalon \\
the new zion beacons you Forward
{: style="text-align: center;"}

the horizon in that infinitesimal shows that both are equally true \\
but much like armstrong, gamgee, and tannhäuser \\
you meekly take a first step towards Deliverance, \\
the physical, in many ways, is unillustrative of the truth
{: style="text-align: center;"}

that the first has within it the Strength of the old days that moved earth and heaven \\
the equal temper of heroic hearts \\
renewed in Graceful spite of time and fate \\
Striving Seeking Finding and Never Yielding
{: style="text-align: center;"}
