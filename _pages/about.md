My friends call me Piper but Joanna or any nicknames derivative of that will work!

I'm a grad student at Oregon State University where I will get my PhD in mechanical engineering with an emphasis in thermal fluid sciences and a minor in nuclear engineering sometime in 2025. 

My current research is in dynamic Monte Carlo neutron transport for high performance/heterogeneous compute systems enabled by Python. This research is part of the [Center for Exascale Monte Carlo Neutron Transport (CEMeNT)](https://cement-psaap.github.io/) which is funded by the NNSA, through which I will get to run computer programs on some of the largest supercomputers in the world!

I also currently work with adding functionality to production transport codes at Los Alamos National Lab. Previously I have interned at Argonne and Thomas Jefferson National Labs where I worked on superconducting/conventional particle accelerator magnet design.

In 2020 I graduated magna cum laude from the Oregon Institute of Technology with my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and two minors in applied physics and applied mathematics.

In my free time I like to volunteer at the historic [Whiteside Theater](https://www.whitesidetheatre.org/) in Corvallis and watch wayyyyyy too much youtube. Otherwise I am known for making a pretty good pun every now and again and kicking butt at trivia! 

At my core I am just a big ol goober

## Academic Lineage
My full academic lineage can be found thru my advisor's ([Kyle Niemeyer](https://niemeyer-research-group.github.io/)) [Mathematics Genealogy Project profile](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=180371), but briefly, I am advised by:

* Kyle Niemyer (Ph.D., Case Western Reserve Univeristy), who was advised by
* Jackie Sung, (Ph.D., Princeton University), who was advised by
* Chung K. Law, (Ph.D., University of California, San Diego), who was advised by
* Forman A. Williams (Ph.D., Caltech), who had Richard Feynman on his dissertation committee and was advised by
* Stanford S. (Sol) Penner (Ph.D., University of Wisconsin–Madison), who was advised by
* Farrington Daniels (Ph.D., Harvard) and Theodore von Kármán (Dr. phil., University of Göttingen), the latter of whom was advised by
* Ludwig Prandtl.
