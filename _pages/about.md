My friends call me Piper but Joanna or any nicknames derivative of that will work!

I'm a grad student at Oregon State University where I will get my PhD in mechanical engineering with an emphasis in thermal fluid sciences and a minor in nuclear engineering sometime in 2025. 

My current research is in dynamic Monte Carlo neutron transport for high performance/heterogeneous compute systems enabled by Python. This research is part of the [Center for Exascale Monte Carlo Neutron Transport (CEMeNT)](https://cement-psaap.github.io/) which is funded by the NNSA, through which I will get to run computer programs on some of the largest supercomputers in the world! I also work on developing transient deterministic neutron transport algorithms for GPU computations.

In addition to my research at OSU with CEMeNT I am currently working at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).

I have previosuly worked with adding functionality to production transport codes at Los Alamos National Lab (XCP-3 & CCS-2). Before that I have interned at Argonne and Thomas Jefferson National Labs where I worked on superconducting/conventional particle accelerator magnet design.

In my free time I like to volunteer at the historic [Whiteside Theater](https://www.whitesidetheatre.org/) in Corvallis, bake my fair share of carrot cake, and watch wayyyyyy too much youtube. Otherwise I am known for making a pretty good pun every now and again and kicking butt at trivia! 

At my core I am just a big ol goober

## Academic Lineage
My full academic lineage can be found thru my advisor's ([Kyle Niemeyer](https://niemeyer-research-group.github.io/)) [Mathematics Genealogy Project profile](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=180371). it's kinda fun to go snooping around and see who you can find!
